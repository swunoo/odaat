## About
- A full stack project, built with TypeScript (React) for the frontend and Java (Spring) for the backend.
- There is still room for improvement, but the application is functional, testable, and maintainable.
- If I had more time, I would work on the issues mentioned in the **Further Development** section.

## Application
- A personal management application that can be used to organize your work into **projects**, **tasks**, and **daily todos**.
- "Projects" are long term work, or repetitive activities. They can include both professional and personal work. Some examples would be *"Create a Marketing Campaign"*, *"Build MyApp"*, or *"Excersise Daily"*.
- "Tasks" are small chunks of work that can be done in one sitting towards the completion of a certain project. Some examples would be *"Design the Key Visual"*, *"Write Unit Tests"*, or *"Go for a Walk"*.
- With the philosophy of consistently making incremental improvements, the application is named **"Odaat"**, or *"One Day at a Time"*.

## Functionalities
- User can login / signup / logout with an email+password, or with a google account.
